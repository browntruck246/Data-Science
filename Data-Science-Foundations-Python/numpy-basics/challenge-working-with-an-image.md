Say we have this image of a flower. We can use Matplotlib to load this image into memory. So we use the imit method. We create a copy to make it readable and then I'm going to use Alt to show it. If you're going to run the cell. You're going to see the flower image. If you look at the type of the image you're going to see that it's a Numpy. Array. And when we? Look at the. Shape of the array we see it's 1200 by 900 on three. These are the number of pixels. So 1200 on 903 values for the color red, green and blue. What I want you to do is draw a Blue Square. Around the flower, the top left should be at 190. On 350 the bottom right should be on 680 and 8:50 and the line width should be 5.
